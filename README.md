# 2D Portals
# Camera controls
 - CTRL + MOUSE_WHEEL changes size of the selection circle
 - Sliding when MIDDLE_MOUSE is pressed moves camera
 - Clicking LEFT_MOUSE when objects selected pins selected objects
 - Clicking MOUSE_RIGHT 2 times creates an edge

## Required additions
 - Time machine (need to be able to look back in time to fix bugs)

## Good to have additions
 - Multifixture support
 - Joint teleporting through portals
 - 0 ofset midFixture (portal line body)
 - Handle things in portal body(Shape class) -will be possible to render objects better-

## Known bugs
 - Objects may disappear
 - Objects may slide near portal edges
